Tickets: https://grandemuseodelduomo.waf.it/en/cumulative-ticket-great-museum-of-the-cathedral-of-florence


<p class="mt-30">Start your visit in Piazza del Duomo in the heart of Florence. Here, the majestic Duomo, or Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, presides with its famous cupola or dome by Brunelleschi, but don't forget to also admire the Baptistery with its bronze Gates of Paradise and Giotto's very tall bell tower. If you want, you can climb to the very top and admire an incredible view of the city. All three can be visited with a single ticket that is valid for 72 hours, keeping in mind you need to book a time to climb up the dome (you can do that when you buy the pass and return later).
I would highly recommend spending an entire morning here to visit all of them but time is limited so just visit the cathedral (free entrance) and see the exquisite mosaic floors and stunning frescoes on the inside the dome over the main altar. Then just admire the beauty of the remaining monuments from the outside.

                        <p>Vini e Vecchi features a short, hand-written traditional menu, which changes on a daily basis depending on the seasonal produce.
                          The pasta includes the unusual, wide-tubed paccheri with classic sauces, such as a particularly good ragu.
                          Another highlight is the homemade zuccotto, a Florentine version of tiramisu: sweet, light, and generously portioned.
                          The service is that of a traditional trattoria, friendly but straightforward; this is a prime example of a truly good, family-run Florence restaurant.</p>

                            I Due Fratellini is old-school sandwich shop serving paninis and wine by the glass to sidewalk patrons. There are around 30 stuffing combinations, including cinghiale piccante con caprino – spicy wild boar salami, spread with creamy goat’s cheese in a split, crunchy roll. Other highlights include ham and salsa, as well as fishy combinations like anchovy with parsley sauce. Run by two brothers, the name ‘I Due Fratellini’ translates into ‘The Two Brothers.’ This place has been dishing out mouthwatering paninis since 1875. The quality is excellent, as apparent from the crowd of locals that throng the sidewalk – a perfect spot for an urban picnic in Florence.

  Continue your walk by taking via dei Calzaiuoli (the street by the bell tower) to reach the magnificent Piazza della Signoria, center of Florence's political power for centuries. Here is the grand Palazzo Vecchio, headquarters of the city government as well as a city museum.

  To the right of Palazzo Vecchio, you can admire the beautiful Loggia dei Lanzi where wonderful statues such as the Perseus by Benvenuto Cellini and the Rape of the Sabines by Giambologna are on display, and in the piazza itself admire Neptune's Fountain by Ammannati and the equestrian statue of Cosimo I by Giambologna.

  On your way along Via Calzaiuoli, you can admire the square architectural structure of the church of Orsanmichele and the many statues that adorn its sides by great artists such as Donatello, Ghiberti and Verrocchio.

<h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cUgSbkh7Kv9PBm2o7"><b>The Uffizi Gallery</b></a></h4>

<p class="mt-30">
  Head right in between Palazzo Vecchio and the Loggia dei Lanzi to arrive at the Uffizi Gallery, one of Italy's top museums and one of the most important in the world with its large collection of Renaissance masterpieces, with works by Botticelli, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael, to name just a few.
If you want to go into the Uffizi Gallery, we recommend you buy Uffizi tickets online ahead of time as there is often a long line outside. Plan to spend at least 2 hours inside the museum or better yet, visit with a guided tour to make sure you don't miss the top masterpieces.

    <td>The Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli</td>
    <td>Perhaps the Uffizi’s most famous work, The Birth of Venus is one of those paintings that has achieved a level of fame that serves to obscure the greatness of the original work. Like the Mona Lisa or the Warhol Marilyn series, our expectations cannot fail to be disappointed, but Botticelli gets incredibly close to justifying the reputation of this work. The alluringly beautifuo Venus standing on her shell is the most remembered aspect, but the work also delights in its little details – in folds of fabric and floating flowers. Its sheer size and beauty also impresses.</td>

    <td>Coronation of the Virgin by Fra Angelico</td>
    <td>One of the most stunning altar-pieces ever created, Fra Angelico‘s work offers us an entire compendium of saints, each giving their own unique character and spirit by the master painter of the 15th century. The painting is stunning enough on its own, but when coupled with the detailed engraving work in the gilt this truly becomes a masterpiece. Originally a triptych, this work offers a wealth of details that allow this work to stand out by itself. However, you can see its sisters at nearby San Marco to get an idea of how Angelico conceived of the triptych.</td>

    <td>Laocoön and his Sons by Baccio Bandinelli</td>
    <td>Part of the Uffizi’s breathtaking sculpture corridor, Bandinelli‘s sculptures teaches us much of what we need to know about artistic methods during the Italian Renaissance. Based on a Hellenistic sculpture unearthed in 1506, Bandinelli took the ruined original and its description by Pliny the Elder and used it to model a modern recreation for Pope Leo X to give as a gift to King Francis I. Here we have the entire story of the Renaissance in microcosm: an artistic commission from a powerful leader based on a work of antiquity, which is then refashioned for a contemporary audience by a master craftsman.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-thumb" src="http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/images-renaissance/parmigianino-madonna.jpg"/></td>
    <td>Madonna with the Long Neck by Parmigianino</td>
    <td>The strange adult-like proportion of the child and the famously long neck present in its colloquial name should work against Parmigianino’s most famous work, yet somehow they seem to imbue the painting with its own unique kind of grace and stillness. In fact, everything in this painting is radical and innovative, from these proportions to its strange perspective, to the highly unusual placement of figures within the painting, showing a painter trying new ways to depict familiar scenes attempted by all the painter’s great predecessors. And the Madonna with the Long Neck is proof that a radical new way can lead to a masterpiece being painted.</td>

    <td>Portrait of Pope Leo X with Two Cardinals by Raphael</td>
    <td>Raphael’s Portrait of Pope Leo X, who commissioned of many of the gallery’s finest works, is another of the quietly revolutionary works that make the Uffizi worth exploring. Raphael eschews the idealism of his time to show the Pope as he must have been in reality, a ‘warts and all’ approach that would not become prominent for at least another century. Furthermore, the master Raphael has filled the painting with references to contemporary events that mean the work has a new detail to offer on every single viewing.</td>

    <td>Head of Christ by Unknown Tuscan Master</td>
    <td>
A painting best-known due to its inclusion in the introduction of EH Gombrich’s seminal Story of Art, this early depiction of the head of Christ is a fascinating insight into a neglected period in the history of art. Before idealised naturalism became the defining mode of art for centuries, works such as these were painted. Ornamentation and the depiction of emotion take precedence over realism, giving the work an exciting air of expressionism that would not return to art until the 20th century. To see this work is to see how the history of art could have taken a very different direction indeed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="img-thumb" src="https://img.theculturetrip.com/1024x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/annunciation_leonardo.jpg"/></td>
    <td>Annunciation by Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea del Verrocchio</td>
    <td>The Uffizi is within the small upper echelon of museums that own a Da Vinci. The Annunciation is one of about 16 paintings we have from perhaps the world’s most famous artist of all time. It is an informative insight into the early da Vinci, who painted this work alongside his master Verrocchio. Although it is now undoubtedly thought to be a collaboration, signs of the signature da Vinci’s style can clearly be seen, particularly on the Angel Gabriel on the left, whose face bears a distinct similarity to the artist’s other works, the La Belle Ferronnière and the Mona Lisa.</td>

    <td><img class="img-thumb" src="https://img.theculturetrip.com/1024x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/caravaggio_medusa-murtola.jpg"/></td>
    <td>Medusa by Caravaggio</td>
    <td>Along with The Birth of Venus, Caravaggio’s Medusa is the work people most associate with the Uffizi Gallery. As well as a gripping study of one of mythology’s most compelling characters, this round-canvas work is an exciting exploration of form from one the great radicals of his time. Representing both the Medusa herself, whose head could turn humans into stone, and the mirrored shield that finally defeated her, the work is a fascinating exploration of opposites and the nature of art as well as a gripping image in its own right.</td>

    <td>Doni Tondo by Michelangelo</td>
    <td>This depiction of the Doni Tondo (also known as ‘The Holy Family’) offers an experience only available at this gallery: the chance to see a panel painting by Michelangelo, for this is the only one that survives. A fascinating precursor to the Sistine Chapel, which he probably began after completing this work, it offers many chances to see Michelangelo’s mastery of bodily form and fabric through its depiction of a robe-wearing holy family flanked by beautiful male nudes. The presence of the former has baffled many art historians.</td>

    <td><img class="img-thumb" src="https://img.theculturetrip.com/1024x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/titian_venus_of_urbino.jpg"/></td>
    <td>Venus of Urbino by Titian</td>
    <td>The best and most famous of Titian’s nudes, the Venus of Urbino is a masterwork of the form and one of the most alluring women in the history of art. Its frank and shameless eroticism was shocking for its time, and the legacy of this work can be traced through artist from Manet through to Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas today. Many, including the writer Mark Twain, see the painting as an obscenity, a pornographic blot in Titian’s faultless career, whilst many others admire the mastery of flesh Titian achieves. View the painting yourself to form your own opinion on one of art’s most controversial pieces.</td>

Crossing Ponte Vecchio while admiring the spectacular goldsmith shops, you reach the Oltrarno area where the Pitti Palace stands magnificently, home today to several splendid museums such as the Palatine Gallery and the Modern Art Gallery, with the impressive Boboli Gardens as its backyard. While the museums take time to visit, if your time is limited and the day is shining, we recommend you visit the gardens.

  If after the Boboli gardens you're not too tired, head to the nearby Piazza Santo Spirito with its Church of Santo Spirito. Built by Brunelleschi, the church stands tall over the square with its simple and yellow facade but hides many artistic treasures inside.

  There are several restaurants and cafes around the square and in the streets nearby that offer excellent Tuscan dishes and wines for you to enjoy at the end of your long first day in Florence!
