                <p class="mt-30">
                  Piazza del Campo is truly unique with its shell shape, its bricks pavement and for all of the buildings facing on it. Standing at the center of the square, you can almost feel wrapped up in a warm embrace. Piazza del Campo hosts, twice a year (on July 2nd and August 16th), the famous Palio di Siena, the most anticipated, exciting event by all of the citizens in Siena.

                  In the square, you can admire the Fonte Gaia, the largest fountain of the city originally decorated with sculptures by Jacopo della Quercia. The fountain as we can see today is a copy made in marble of Carrara marble, which is much stronger than the marble of the Montagnola used by della Quercia (the ancient Fonte Gaia ha been restored and is visible within the museum complex of Santa Maria della Scala).

                  Among the buildings overlooking Piazza del Campo, you will see and should visit the Palazzo Comunale (or Palazzo Pubblico, which is the city's Town Hall) and the Torre del Mangia.

                  The imposing Palazzo Comunale, made in brick and marble, houses the Civic Museum with several masterpieces of Sienese artists, including the beautiful Majesty by Simone Martini and the cycle of frescoes called "Good and Bad Government" by Ambrogio Lorenzetti. Both are quite spectacular and should be seen in person.

                <p class="mt-30">
                  The Torre del Mangia, with its height of 87 meters, offers one of the most beautiful views of the city. The climb can be a bit tiring: there are over 400 steps, a bit steep and narrow, to climb but the 360° view that awaits you on the top of the tower is really spectacular and worth the "effort" you go through to reach the top.

For those who want to visit both the Civic Museum and the Torre del Mangia, I recommend to buy the combined ticket (available only at the ticket office of the Tower), which costs € 13. If you have the time, the frescoes of "Good and Bad" Government within the Civic Museum are extraordinary!

                <p class="mt-30">

                  The Baptistery is dedicated to San Giovanni (St. John) and was built in 1300 when it was decided to enlarge the Duomo. The Baptistery, with entry from Piazza San Giovanni, is easily recognizable for its incomplete marble facade. The interior of the Baptistery is beautifully decorated with a cycle of frescoes by some Sienese artists of the Renaissance. The most precious masterpiece preserved inside the Baptistery is without a doubt the beautiful baptismal font created by some of the greatest sculptors of the Renaissance: Jacopo della Quercia, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Donatello.

                <p class="mt-30">

                  The Museo dell'Opera del Duomo is one of the oldest private museums in Italy and is located in the south side of the Cathedral, in an area that should have been an extension of the church on the basis of the project of the "New Cathedral", which was never completed.

                  Here, you can admire the original statues from the facade of the Cathedral, including those made by Giovanni Pisano, the window of the apse by Duccio da Buoninsegna and one of the greatest masterpieces of the early Fourteenth century by Buoninsegna: the altarpiece of the Majesty.

                  From the very top, you will get a great view of the cathedral and the rest of Siena!

                <p class="mt-30">

                  The complex of Santa Maria della Scala is one of the oldest hospitals in Europe, where pilgrims were welcomed (Siena is along the ancient Via Francigena pilgrimage route which connected Rome to central Europe) as well as the poor and abandoned children.

                  The complex is located right in front of the Duomo, so is very easy to reach and visit.

                  Santa Maria della Scala still has some parts under restoration, but still remains open to the public, and houses a vast artistic heritage as well as temporary exhibitions.

                  Arranged on four levels (the second is not yet accessible), it is a sort of "city within a city", so I suggest you consider if you have enough time to visit the entire complex or not before going in (as I have already said, you really should consider coming back to Siena for more than a day).

                    <p>Vini e Vecchi features a short, hand-written traditional menu, which changes on a daily basis depending on the seasonal produce.
                      The pasta includes the unusual, wide-tubed paccheri with classic sauces, such as a particularly good ragu.
                      Another highlight is the homemade zuccotto, a Florentine version of tiramisu: sweet, light, and generously portioned.
                      The service is that of a traditional trattoria, friendly but straightforward; this is a prime example of a truly good, family-run Florence restaurant.</p>

                      I Due Fratellini is old-school sandwich shop serving paninis and wine by the glass to sidewalk patrons. There are around 30 stuffing combinations, including cinghiale piccante con caprino – spicy wild boar salami, spread with
                      creamy goat’s cheese in a split, crunchy roll. Other highlights include ham and salsa, as well as fishy combinations like anchovy with parsley sauce. Run by two brothers, the name ‘I Due Fratellini’ translates into ‘The Two
                      Brothers.’ This place has been dishing out mouthwatering paninis since 1875. The quality is excellent, as apparent from the crowd of locals that throng the sidewalk – a perfect spot for an urban picnic in Florence.

                <p class="mt-30">
Travel through Tuscany like a local—on the back of your own vintage Vespa scooter—on this half-day tour from Florence. Follow your guide's lead, and take in sights such as the Church of San Miniato al Monte, Piazzale Michelangelo, and the rolling Tuscan hills without the added stress of following a map or deciphering Italian traffic signs. Plus, rest and refuel with an included lunch of traditional fare.
                  </p>

                  <p class="mt-30">
                    Meet your guide and small group of 10 or fewer in central Florence. Listen to a safety briefing, and get comfortable on the provided vintage PK Vespa. Your guide will ensure you feel ready to drive safely.
Follow your guide through the city streets on your way to your first stop, the Church of San Miniato al Monte. Explore this less-visited Romanesque gem, and take in panoramic views of distant Florence.
Pass vineyards and poppy fields as you head into the Tuscan hills. Take breaks for photos, and to listen to your guide talk about the area’s history and culture. Make a stop at the Piazzale Michelangelo, from which you can see Florence’s Duomo and the Arno River.
Back in town, eat an authentic Tuscan meal on a private terrace. Afterward, head to your original departure point to return your scooter and helmet.
