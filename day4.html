                  Tuscan Cooking: Fruits and Flavors of Chianti Country (4.5 HOURS LENGHT)<br>
                  This high-end wine and culinary experience in Chianti takes place at the famed Badia a Coltibuono, the cooking school of Lorenza de Medici. The morning starts with a guided tour of the grounds and property, an 11th century abbey,
                  including the wine cellars. Chef Andrea Gagnesi leads the 3-hour class in which students prepare a 4-course Tuscan meal. Lunch is served in the private dining room where you’ll also taste the wines and olive oils from the estate.

                <p class="mt-30">
                  Piazza del Campo is truly unique with its shell shape, its bricks pavement and for all of the buildings facing on it. Standing at the center of the square, you can almost feel wrapped up in a warm embrace. Piazza del Campo hosts,
                  twice a year (on July 2nd and August 16th), the famous Palio di Siena, the most anticipated, exciting event by all of the citizens in Siena.

                  In the square, you can admire the Fonte Gaia, the largest fountain of the city originally decorated with sculptures by Jacopo della Quercia. The fountain as we can see today is a copy made in marble of Carrara marble, which is much
                  stronger than the marble of the Montagnola used by della Quercia (the ancient Fonte Gaia ha been restored and is visible within the museum complex of Santa Maria della Scala).

                  Among the buildings overlooking Piazza del Campo, you will see and should visit the Palazzo Comunale (or Palazzo Pubblico, which is the city's Town Hall) and the Torre del Mangia.

                  The imposing Palazzo Comunale, made in brick and marble, houses the Civic Museum with several masterpieces of Sienese artists, including the beautiful Majesty by Simone Martini and the cycle of frescoes called "Good and Bad
                  Government" by Ambrogio Lorenzetti. Both are quite spectacular and should be seen in person.

                <p class="mt-30">
                  The Torre del Mangia, with its height of 87 meters, offers one of the most beautiful views of the city. The climb can be a bit tiring: there are over 400 steps, a bit steep and narrow, to climb but the 360° view that awaits you on
                  the top of the tower is really spectacular and worth the "effort" you go through to reach the top.

                  For those who want to visit both the Civic Museum and the Torre del Mangia, I recommend to buy the combined ticket (available only at the ticket office of the Tower), which costs € 13. If you have the time, the frescoes of "Good and
                  Bad" Government within the Civic Museum are extraordinary!

                  From here, our tour of Siena continues on to the precious Piazza del Duomo. While it is one stop, it is full of treasures that will take you the rest of the day to explore. Here you will enjoy some of the most magnificent treasures
                  of Siena which I recommend you visit inside: the Cathedral, the Crypt and the Piccolomini Library.

                <p class="mt-30">

                  The Baptistery is dedicated to San Giovanni (St. John) and was built in 1300 when it was decided to enlarge the Duomo. The Baptistery, with entry from Piazza San Giovanni, is easily recognizable for its incomplete marble facade. The
                  interior of the Baptistery is beautifully decorated with a cycle of frescoes by some Sienese artists of the Renaissance. The most precious masterpiece preserved inside the Baptistery is without a doubt the beautiful baptismal font
                  created by some of the greatest sculptors of the Renaissance: Jacopo della Quercia, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Donatello.

                    <br>
                    <p>Vini e Vecchi features a short, hand-written traditional menu, which changes on a daily basis depending on the seasonal produce.
                      The pasta includes the unusual, wide-tubed paccheri with classic sauces, such as a particularly good ragu.
                      Another highlight is the homemade zuccotto, a Florentine version of tiramisu: sweet, light, and generously portioned.
                      The service is that of a traditional trattoria, friendly but straightforward; this is a prime example of a truly good, family-run Florence restaurant.</p>

                    <p>
                      I Due Fratellini is old-school sandwich shop serving paninis and wine by the glass to sidewalk patrons. There are around 30 stuffing combinations, including cinghiale piccante con caprino – spicy wild boar salami, spread with
                      creamy goat’s cheese in a split, crunchy roll. Other highlights include ham and salsa, as well as fishy combinations like anchovy with parsley sauce. Run by two brothers, the name ‘I Due Fratellini’ translates into ‘The Two
                      Brothers.’ This place has been dishing out mouthwatering paninis since 1875. The quality is excellent, as apparent from the crowd of locals that throng the sidewalk – a perfect spot for an urban picnic in Florence.

                  Puccini (a native son of Lucca) and his fellow composers. Performances run about one hour, making an 8:30 dinner feasible. Great value.</p>

                      The present mechanism of the clock dates to the 18th-century. It is unclear what the face of the clock and the mechanism consisted in 1390. Earlier clock towers did have hour markings.

                      There is also an ancient legend surrounding the tower: the tallest tree was planted by Paolo Guinigi who was captured and imprisoned in the castle by Francesco Sforza. It is said that before his execution, all the leaves fell
                      off the tree.

                <p>
                  First of all, we have to clarify that only bastions have undergrounds, while the straight walls are full because they needed to resist to the cannon shots. So, the walking tour of the underground brought us along an itinerary
                  passing on top of the walls and inside the bastions of San Paolino, Santa Croce, and San Martino.
                </p>

                    <td>The first stop of the tour was in front of the old building of the Ex Manifattura Tabacchi, an old factory of tobacco operating from the middle of 19th century that now moved out of the city. Then we proceeded to the first
                      bastion of San Paolino that was recently renovated preserving the original structure. Today the underground houses special events and exhibits (if the humidity level is not too high), and there is also an exit path to get out
                      from the walls. Along the corridor, it was still possible (at the time of the visit) to admire two artworks made on paper and wood from the last event called Cartasia that every two years takes place in town.</td>

                    <td>
                      Differently from the others, the bastion of San Donato has not underground. It is situated between the Porta Sant Anna and Porta San Donato where we stopped listening to the tour guide that told us that this bastion has always
                      been unsafe because built over a patch of swampy ground. Adjoined to the bastion there is an old barrack, the old horse stables and the ruins of the old walls further in.

                    <td>Santa Croce</td>
                    <td>The next underground we explored was the bastion of Santa Croce. The bastion of Santa Croce is dedicated to the Holy Face, the venerated wooden crucifix hosted in the cathedral of San Martino that is also one of the patrons of
                      Lucca. On the outside, the bastion is wide, very green and bright, and give some nice panoramic glimpses of the towers and roofs of the town. It is well preserved and we can still see the ruins of the medieval walls and the old
                      soldier barrack. It was interesting to go under and visit the undergrounds that are open to public only during special events. During the Second World War, this space was used as a shelter for the civilians, and we can still see
                      the rest of the foundations of the old medieval fortifications that during the Renaissance were merged with the modern city walls. Santa Croce Bastion is definitely my favorite, and I came back a few days later to enjoy the view
                      and a rest on the grass under the shadow of its trees. I discovered that the old barrack of the bastion years ago was an office of the Carabinieri Corps, and today it hosts a studio of painting. This is a good example of
                      requalification which also allows local people to live an important old building of the history of the town.</td>
